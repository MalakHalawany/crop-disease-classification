# 🌿 Plant Disease Classification with Deep Learning

This repository provides trained deep learning models for detecting plant diseases using leaf images from the PlantVillage dataset. Models include CNN, EfficientNet, VGG16, and custom architectures.

## 🔍 Project Overview
We trained and evaluated five models:
- `model_CNN_GPU_` (Custom CNN optimized for GPU)
- `model_DN`
- `plant_disease_model_EfficientNet1`
- `plant_disease_model_EfficientNet1_final`
- `VGG16`
